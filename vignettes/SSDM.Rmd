The package ‘SSDM’ is a computer platform implemented in R providing a range of methodological approaches and parameterization at each step of the SSDM building. This vignette presents a typical workflow in R command to use it. An additionnal vignette presents the same workflow using the graphic user interface with `gui` function (see [GUI](GUI.html) vignette).

The workflow of the package ‘SSDM’ is based on three levels: 

1. an individual SDM is fitted by linking occurrences of a single species to environmental predictor variables based on the response curve of a single computer algorithm
2. for each species, an ensemble SDM (ESDM) can be created from several algorithm outputs to create a model that captures components of each
3. species assemblage from an SSDM is predicted by stacking several SDM or ESDM outputs (Fig. 1).

## Data inputs

### Natural history records

Species distribution models are built on natural history records. 

‘SSDM’ include `load_occ` function to read raw csv or txt files including your natural history records. We will work with natural history records from five Cryptocarya species native to New Caledonia (see `?Occurrences`).  

```{r Natural history records}
library(SSDM)
Occ <- load_occ(path = system.file('extdata',  package = 'SSDM'), Env,
         Xcol = 'LONGITUDE', Ycol = 'LATITUDE',
         file = 'Occurences.txt', sep = ',', verbose = FALSE)
head(Occ)
```

*Remarks: You need to first load environmental data because occurrences are checked to be in the  extent of environmental data. In addition take care to `GeoRes` option which allow thinning. Thinning aims to remove the fewest records necessary to reduce the effect of sampling bias, while retaining the greatest amount of information. Finally if you have issues to open your file look at additional options of `read.csv` function used to open you raw data.*

### Environmental variables

In addition to build species distribution models you will need environmental variables. Currently ‘SSDM’ uses all raster formats supported by the R package ‘rgdal’. The package ‘SSDM’ supports both continuous (e.g., climate maps, digital elevation models, bathymetric maps) and categorical environmental variables (e.g., land cover maps, soil type maps) as inputs. The package also allows normalizing environmental variables, which may be useful to improve the fit of certain algorithms (like artificial neural networks).

Rasters of environmental data need to have the same coordinate reference system while spatial extent and resolution of the environmental layers can differ. During processing, the package will deal with between-variables discrepancies in spatial extent and resolution by rescaling all environmental rasters to the smallest common spatial extent then upscaling them to the coarsest resolution.

‘SSDM’ include `load_var` function to read raster files including your environmental variables. We will work with three 30 arcsec-resolution rasters covering the north part of the main island of New Caledonia ’Grande Terre’. Climatic variables (RAINFALL and TEMPERATURE) are from the WorldClim database, and the SUBSTRATE map is from the IRD Atlas of New Caledonia (2012) (see `?Env`).  

```{r Environmental variables}
Env <- load_var(system.file('extdata',  package = 'SSDM'), categorical = 'SUBSTRATE', verbose = FALSE)
Env
```

*Remarks: Take care to correctly precise which environmental variable is categorical with `categorical` parameter. Normalization is activated by default, check `Norm` option.*

## Model algorithms

### Individual species distribution models (SDMs)

First, you can build an individual species distribution model using one algorithm and one species. The package ‘SSDM’ includes the main algorithms used to model species distributions: general additive models (GAM), generalized linear models (GLM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), classification tree analysis (CTA), generalized boosted models (GBM), maximum entropy (Maxent), artificial neural networks (ANN), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). Default parameters of the dependent R package of each algorithm were conserved but most of them remain settable.

```{r SDM}
SDM <- modelling('GLM', subset(Occurrences, Occurrences$SPECIES == 'elliptica'), 
                 Env, Xcol = 'LONGITUDE', Ycol = 'LATITUDE', verbose = FALSE)
plot(SDM@projection, main = 'SDM\nfor Cryptocarya elliptica\nwith GLM algorithm')
```

*Remarks: The package ‘SSDM’ encompass a large methodolgy offered by litterature. Have a look at all parameters for `modelling` function with `?modelling`.*

### Ensemble species distribution models (ESDMs)

Secondly, you can build an ensemble species distribution model using several algorithm and one species. Because uncertainty in distribution projections can skew policy making and planning, one recommendation is to fit a number of alternative model algorithms and to explore the range of projections across the different SDMs and then to find consensus in SDM projections. Two consensus methods are implemented in the package ‘SSDM’: 

1. a simple average of the SDM outputs
2. a weighted average based on a user-specified metric or group of metrics (presented below). 

The package also provides an uncertainty map representing the between-algorithms variance. The degree of agreement between each pair of algorithms can be assessed through a correlation matrix giving the Pearson's coefficient.


```{r ESDM}
ESDM <- ensemble_modelling(c('CTA', 'MARS'), subset(Occurrences, Occurrences$SPECIES == 'elliptica'),
                           Env, rep = 1, Xcol = 'LONGITUDE', Ycol = 'LATITUDE',
                          ensemble.thresh = c(0.6), verbose = FALSE)
plot(ESDM@projection, main = 'ESDM\nfor Cryptocarya elliptica\nwith CTA and MARS algorithms')
```

*Remarks: The package ‘SSDM’ encompass a large methodolgy offered by litterature. Have a look at all parameters for `ensemble_modelling` function with `?ensemble_modelling`.*

### Stacked species distribution models (SSDMs)

Finally, you can build a stacked species distribution model using several algorihtms and multiple species. The final maps of local species richness and composition can be computed through six different methods: 

1. by summing discrete presence/absence maps (bSSDM) derived from one of the six metrics available to compute binary maps
2. by summing discrete presence/absence maps obtained by drawing repeatedly from a Bernoulli distribution 
3. by summing continuous habitat suitability maps (pSSDM) 
4. by applying the ‘probability ranking’ rule (PRR) of the SESAM framework (a number of species equal to the prediction of species richness is selected on the basis of decreasing probability of presence calculated by the SDMs) with species richness as estimated by a pSSDM (referred to as ‘PRR.pSSDM’)
5. by applying the PRR with species richness as estimated by a MEM (‘PRR.MEM’)
6. by using the maximum-likelihood adjustment approach

```{r SSDM}
SSDM <- stack_modelling(c('CTA', 'SVM'), Occurrences, Env, rep = 1,
                       Xcol = 'LONGITUDE', Ycol = 'LATITUDE',
                       Spcol = 'SPECIES', method = "pSSDM", verbose = FALSE)
plot(SSDM@diversity.map, main = 'SSDM\nfor Cryptocarya genus\nwith CTA and SVM algorithms')
```

## Outputs

### Model accuracy assessment

A range of metrics to evaluate models have been integrated in the package ‘SSDM’ using the package ‘SDMTools’. They include the area under the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), the Cohen's Kappa coefficient, the omission rate, the sensitivity (true positive rate) and the specificity (true negative rate). These metrics are all based on the confusion matrix (also called ‘error matrix’, which represents the instances in a predicted class versus the instances in an actual class) and, consequently, need an a priori conversion of habitat suitability maps into binary presence/absence maps.

```{r SDM evaluation}
knitr::kable(ESDM@evaluation)
```

To assess the accuracy of an SSDM, the package provides the opportunity to compare modeled species assemblages with species pools from independent inventories observed in the field. Six evaluation metrics can be computed: (1) the species richness error, i.e. the difference between the predicted and observed species richness; (2) assemblage prediction success, i.e. the proportion of correct predictions; (3) assemblage Cohen’s kappa, i.e. the proportion of specific agreement; (4) assemblage specificity, i.e. the proportion of true negatives (species that are both predicted and observed as being absent); (5) assemblage sensitivity, i.e. the proportion of true positives (species that are both predicted and observed as present); and (6) the Jaccard index, a widely used metric of community similarity.

```{r SSDM evaluation}
knitr::kable(SSDM@evaluation)
```

### Importance analysis of environmental variables

The package ‘SSDM’ provides two measures of the relative contribution of environmental variables, which quantifies the relevance of an environmental variable to determine species distribution. The first one is based on a jack knife approach that evaluates the change in accuracy between a full model and one with each environmental variable omitted in turns. All metrics available in the package can serve to assess the change in accuracy. The second method is based on the Pearson's correlation coefficient between a full model and one with each environmental variable omitted in turns.

```{r SSDM variable importance}
knitr::kable(SSDM@variable.importance)
```

### Endemism mapping

In addition to species richness, endemism is an important feature for conservation as it refers to species being unique to the defined geographic location. The package ‘SSDM’ offers the opportunity to map local species endemism using two metrics: 

1. the weighted endemism index (WEI)
2. the corrected weighted endemism index

```{r SSDM endemism}
plot(SSDM@endemism.map, main = 'Endemism map\nfor Cryptocarya genus\nwith CTA and SVM algorithms')
```

### Summary plot

All results can be sumarize inside a shiny dashboard by calling `plot` method directly on an SSDM object.

```{r plot}
# plot(SSDM)
```
