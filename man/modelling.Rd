This is a function to build an SDM with one algorithm for a single species.
The function takes as inputs an occurrence data frame made of presence/absence
or presence-only records and a raster object for data extraction and
projection. The function returns an S4 \linkS4class{Algorithm.SDM} class
object containing the habitat suitability map, the binary map and the
evaluation table.
